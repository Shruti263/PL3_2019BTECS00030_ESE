     <h3>The beatles are regarded as the most influential band of all time and 
        were integral to the development of 1960s counterculture and popular music's recognition as an art form. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, 
        their sound incorporated elements of classical music and traditional pop in innovative ways; 
        the band later explored music styles ranging from ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock. 
        As pioneers in recording, songwriting and artistic presentation, 
        the Beatles revolutionised many aspects of the music industry and were often publicised as leaders of the era's youth and sociocultural movements.</h3>
